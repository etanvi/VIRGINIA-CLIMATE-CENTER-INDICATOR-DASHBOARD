Project Title: Virginia Climate Center Indicator Dashboard

Abstract:
This project analyzes trends in heat waves, cold waves, and extreme rainfall events in Virginia from 1951 to 2023. Leveraging the NOAA Monthly U.S. Climate Gridded Dataset (NClimGrid), we analyze the frequency, intensity, and duration of these events, along with their spatial distribution across the state.  Employing Google Colab and BigQuery for data manipulation and Tableau for data visualization, we developed an interactive dashboard that enables users to explore the data and visualize the temporal and spatial patterns of these events. Our findings reveal a significant increase in the frequency, intensity, and duration of heat waves and cold waves in Virginia over the past 70 years. Furthermore, the spatial distribution of these events has shifted, with heat waves becoming more prevalent in coastal areas and cold waves becoming more common inland. Additionally, we observed an increase in the frequency of extreme rainfall events in Virginia over the past 70 years. These events are most prevalent during the spring and fall seasons. Our findings have substantial implications for policymakers and the public. Firstly, they suggest that Virginia is becoming increasingly vulnerable to heat waves, cold waves, and extreme rainfall events. Secondly, they indicate that these events are likely to become more common and severe in the future. Consequently, policymakers must implement measures to prepare for and mitigate the impacts of these events.
